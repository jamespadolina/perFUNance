#About:

perFUNance is a HR gamification application that is used to motivate employee participation, engagement, and loyalty. Where users have a chance to earn points to pay for rewards. In our gamification platform we used minesweeper, where players input an amount of points that they own and gamble to double their points and also be able to earn bonus points if they win.
